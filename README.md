# AI-Driven Developer Teammate Finder

## Executive Summary
The AI-Driven Developer Teammate Finder is a web application that matches developers with potential teammates based on their skills, interests, and availability. The platform will utilize AI algorithms to provide personalized recommendations, promoting collaboration and fostering the growth of development teams. The project aims to help developers find compatible partners to work on projects or start-ups, share knowledge, and improve their skills.

## Objectives
Provide a user-friendly platform for developers to create profiles detailing their skills, interests, and availability
Utilize AI algorithms to match developers based on compatibility
Offer a communication channel for matched developers to connect and collaborate
Create a Freemium model with premium features to monetize the platform

## Scope
- Web application built using Advanced React and TypeScript
- Serverless backend utilizing AWS, Firebase, or Cloud Functions
- Integration of AI algorithms for matching developers
- Component library for UI components
- PWA for improved user experience on mobile devices
